// Write a program called MilagePrinter that asks the user to input the 
// following values:
//	- The number of gallons currently in the tank
//	- The fuel efficiency in miles per gallon

// Assume the cost per gallon is $3.95. Define it as a constant:
// * final double COST_PER_GALLON = 3.95;

// If value entered for efficiency is less than or equal to 0, print 
// "No can go". 
// Otherwise continue with the following calculations. 


// Print how far the car can go on the gas in the tank and the cost of driving 
// 100 miles.
// Print the distance with 1 decimal point and the cost with 2 decimals.

// Sample runs for the final:
// Enter the number of gallons of gas in the tank 5.1
// Enter the fuel efficiency 35.0
// Distance:   178.5
// Cost:       11.29

// Enter the number of gallons of gas in the tank 25
// Enter the fuel efficiency -5
// No can go 

// For the draft, define a constant for the cost per gallon and ask the user 
// for both inputs (don't forget the prompt). 
// Then print both the number of gallons and the fuel efficiency on one line 
// with no text

// Sample run for the draft:
// Enter the number of gallons of gas in the tank 4.2
// Enter the fuel efficiency 35
// 4.2 35.0 

//Important: Be sure to print the string exactly like this. "No can go"
